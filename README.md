We are creating an application to track departments, employees and tickets.

* Departments have a name and a floor.
	* ex. name: ‘IT’, floor: ‘Basement’
* Employees have a name, and level
	* ex. name: ‘Christina Aguilera’, level: 2
* Tickets have a subject, age (integer), and open (boolean) attributes
	* ex. subject: ‘printers broken’, age: 5, open: true

* Departments have many Employees
* Employees belong to a Department
* Employees have many Tickets
* Tickets can belong to many Employees

Some of the initial model set up and testing has been done for you.

## User Stories
```
Story 1
Department Index

As a user,
When I visit the Department index page,
I see each department's name and floor
And underneath each department, I can see the names of all of its employees
```
```
Story 2
Employee Show

As a user,
When I visit the Employee show page,
I see the employee's name and department name,
and I see a list of the employee's tickets including the ticket subject and age,
And I see that this list is ordered from oldest to youngest, 
And I see that this list only includes open tickets
```
```
Story 3

As a user,
When I visit the employee show page,
I do not see any tickets listed that are not assigned to the employee
and I see a form to add a ticket to this employee
When I fill in the form with the id of a ticket that already exists in the database
and I click submit
Then I am redirected back to that employees show page
and i see the ticket's subject now listed
(you do not have to test for sad path, for example if the id does not match an existing ticket)
```
## Extension
```

As a user,
When I visit an employee show page,
